## Interesting Breakout Variants
I thought Brick Breaker Hero was an interesting variant of Breakout. I like
that the game feels more like a video game than a traditional version of
Breakout due to the boss enemy and the graphics. I think that the simplicity
of Brick Breaker Hero shows that it's possible to make a unique game from the
basics of Breakout with just a few creative design choices. The different boss
enemies also give each level its own feel, which makes the game more exciting
and encourages the user to keep completing levels to see a new game setting.

Centipong is another version of Breakout that I liked. I think variants with
multiple balls add another layer of complexity and a more fast-paced feel to
the game, and I think that the centipede up top introduces these extra balls
in a creative way. The different colors and balls flying across the screen
creates an exciting visual as well, especially when they all experience a
power up at the same time. I think these graphics are a great example of how
to make a game look good without unnecessarily complex elements.
